 * The value of the attributes key MUST be an object (an `attributes object`).
 * Members of the attributes object (`attributes`) represent information about the resource object in which itâ€™s defined.
 *
 * Attributes may contain any valid JSON value.
 *
 * Complex data structures involving JSON objects and arrays are allowed as attribute values.
 * However, any object that constitutes or is contained in an attribute MUST NOT contain a
 * `relationships` or `links` member, as those members are reserved by this specification for future use.
 *
 * Although has-one foreign keys (e.g. author_id) are often stored internally alongside other
 * information to be represented in a resource object, these keys SHOULD NOT appear as attributes.
